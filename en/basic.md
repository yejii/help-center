### Booking with Credits

Some coworking spaces may use credits for room booking. Credits are a kind of virtual currency and look like emoji: ‚≠êÔ∏è, üíé or üçë.

#### Getting Credits

There are two ways to get credits:

* Subscribe to a monthly membership plan for automated credit delivery.
* Ask community manager to manually add credits to your account.

#### Using Credits

When you book a meeting room, credits will be displayed as a payment option. Each meeting room displays hourly credit price. Make sure you have enough credits to complete booking. If you cancel booking before it starts, 100% of credits will be refunded.

### Booking with Cash

Some coworking spaces allow to pay with cash at the counter after you make a booking. Each meeting room displays hourly price. When you book with cash, we'll update your `Cash balance` to display how much you owe to pay at the counter. If you cancel booking before it starts, 100% of credits will be refunded.
