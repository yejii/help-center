4. Fill in `New booking` form: start time, end time, title, notes, and payment method. Depending on your organization settings, some options may not be available.

> Administrator can book on behalf of another member of an organization. Payment for booking will be charged to the selected member.

5. Complete booking by pressing a big blue button at the bottom of the booking page.

#### Booking with Credits

Some coworking spaces may use credits for room booking. Credits are a kind of virtual currency and look like emoji: ⭐️, 💎 or 🍑.

##### Getting Credits

There are three ways to get credits:

* Subscribe to an individual monthly membership plan for automated credit delivery.
* Join a team with a membership plan and shared credit account.
* Ask administrator or moderator \(community manager\) to manually add credits to your account.

> Administrator can adjust credit balance from user or team page in `Directory`.

##### Types of Credits

There are two types of credits:

* Permanent credits — manually added by administrator or moderator. Never expire.
* Temporary credits — received automatically with a membership plan. Expire at the end of the month or together with a membership plan.

> Administrator can adjust how temporary credits are received and expired in `Settings`.

##### Using Credits

When you book a meeting room, individual and/or team credits will be displayed as a payment option. Each meeting room displays hourly credit price. Make sure you have enough credits to complete booking. If you cancel booking before it starts, 100% of credits will be refunded. If you cancel booking made with temporary credits, credits will be refunded only if their expiration date hasn't passed.

#### Booking with Cards

If `Billing System` is enabled for your coworking space, you will see an option to pay with card in `New booking` page. 

> Administrator can contact support@andcards.com to enable `Billing System`

##### Adding Cards

Add a check or credit card by filling in details. Double check that your card belongs to one of the supported payment systems. After one successful purchase, your card will be saved for easy 1-click payments. If you'd like to remove a saved card, contact andCards support.

##### Using Cards

Some cards require 3-D Secure procedure to confirm payment. In such case, you will see `Confirm Payment` button that opens a browser page with your bank's confirmation dialogue. After a successful 3-D Secure confirmation, the browser page will redirect back to andCards Suite and "Booking successful" alert will be displayed. 

If 3-D Secure confirmation was successful but redirect didn't happen, proceed as follows:
* Manually close the browser page.
* Return to andCards Suite.
* Close the `New booking` page.
* Wait for a few minutes to see your booking show up on calendar.

Some banks put a short timeout on 3-D Secure confirmation process, and you may see an error message or a failed redirect. In such cases please follow the steps above to return to calendar and if your booking doesn't show up within 2-3 minutes, try again.

If you cancel booking made with cards, the transaction will not be cancelled automatically. Ask administrator or moderator for a refund.

#### Booking with Cash

Administrators and moderators can use cash payment method to track if a user has already paid at the counter. We'll update user's `Cash balance` to reflect how much they owe to pay at the counter. 

Check `Payment received` if a user already paid. The transaction will display as approved and user's balance will remain 0.

Uncheck `Payment received` if a user hasn't paid yet. The transaction will display as "pending" and user's balance will become negative.

#### Booking for Free

Administrators and moderators can book any room for free.
